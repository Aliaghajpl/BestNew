# 2nd project meeting, October 31

Present: All?

## Comments

 - Main focus on quadrotor side is trajectory following that is robust to wind disturbance

 - Sofie looking into constructing finite approximate simulations of POMDPs as a potential formalization of FIRM.

 - Richard points out that the KISS RSE project superficially looks very similar (implemented on underwater robots). Should try to put in a differentiating aspect in the demo:
	- Belief space planning in the air?
	- Optimization under battery constraint?
	- Belief barrier function?

## Next steps

 - Schedule next meeting around Nov 20.
 - Finish report draft within the next week.

## Conference targets

 - ICAPS for first report?
 - Potentially RSS, but need hardware
