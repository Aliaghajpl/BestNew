 # Oct 18 2017, Skype

Present: Rohan, Sofie, Petter, Cristian, Ali

## Administrative

 - Use https://github.com/shaesaert/BeST for latex and sync to sharelatex
 - Meeting tomorrow 10/19 regarding current status of code
 - Next meeting with faculty will likely be on Oct 31, 3pm-4pm

## Project format

 - We will move project forward with different reports that are developed in parallell

# Minutes by Ali

## Led by Crist i)

Mtg w/ Cristi to get/learn the code
We get and add the results to the report

Sofie will look into the theory and fix the measure theoretic aspect
Sofie is booked until Friday. After that, she will contribute to the first report

Currently, there is a disconnect between theory and code on the first report
So, the report needs to be updated. We will try to keep the theory as general as possible. But, we explicitly mention the simplifications at the beginning of the experiments.

These gaps will give us ideas for the next contribution and report.

We will meet with Rich and Aaron on Oct. 31st
Rohan will send the meeting email soon.

## 2)	Second Report (Led by Petter)
This report will make the connection between theory and experiments of the first report stronger. We will do this by making the theory more tracatable and by having better experiemnts (potentially involving quadcopters)

## 3)	Formal abstraction in LTL Under Uncertainty (Led by Sofie)
This report will take a step back and look more carefully into the abstraction in belief space with better guarantees.

## 4)	Planning in JPL (Led by Kamak/Ali)
We will review the existing methods in JPL and put our work into the context.

## 5)	Software and Scenario overview (led by Rohan/Kyon/Petter)
We will build the overall scenario as well as the software framework (ROS nodes) here

## 6)	Belief space planning (Led by Rohan)
We will connect the “where to look” project to the PDF project

## 7)	CLF/CBF in belief space (Led by Petter/Rohan)
Extends the CLF/CBF ideas to the uncertain setting 

## 8)	Better terrain classification (Led by Kyon/Shreyansh)
To be used in our classification module within BSTL
