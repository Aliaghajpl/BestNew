# Meeting 11/6

Present: Aaron, Thomas, Andrew, Petter

## Status
 - Can generate trajectories with FROST and GPOPS, we have stabilizing LQR
 - Pixhawk quadrotor almost ready

## Next steps
 - Hardware: connect to Optitrack in CAST
 	- ROS node wiki.ros.org/ros_vrpn_client
 	- Markers are from BNL Engineering, but we were given a few
 - Andrew: Time-varying LQR, altitude control
 - Petter: Test FROST trajectories in simulation, add virtual constraints to get CLFs, implement and test SOS barrier approaches
