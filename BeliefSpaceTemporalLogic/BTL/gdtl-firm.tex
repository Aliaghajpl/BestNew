%One of the greatest challenges of motion planning in robotics 
%is dealing with uncertainty in the robot's location and motion.
%In this paper, we present a sampling-based planner for
%persistent missions with temporal and uncertainty constraints.
%We introduce a specification language called
%{\em Gaussian Distribution Temporal Logic (GDTL)},
%an extension of Boolean logic that allows us to incorporate
%temporal evolution and noise mitigation directly into the task
%specifications,
%e.g. "Go to region A and reduce the variance of your position
%estimate below 0.1 $m^2$."
%Our motion planning algorithm
%%adapts the computationally efficient feedback information roadmap planner to
%generates a transition system in the belief space.
%The planner breaks the {\em curse of history} associated
%with belief space planning using local feedback controllers,
%which makes automata-based methods tractable.
%Control policies are then computed using a product
%Markov Decision Process (MDP) between
%the transition system and the Rabin automaton encoding 
%the task specification.
%We present algorithms to translate a GDTL formula to a Rabin
%automaton and to efficiently construct the product MDP
%by leveraging recent results from incremental computing.
%Our approach is evaluated in simulation and hardware
%experiments using a camera network and ground robot.

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we present a sampling-based algorithm
to synthesize control policies with temporal and
uncertainty constraints.
We introduce a specification language called
{\em Gaussian Distribution Temporal Logic (GDTL)},
an extension of Boolean logic that allows us to incorporate
temporal evolution and noise mitigation directly into the task
specifications,
e.g. ``Go to region A and reduce the variance of your state
estimate below 0.1 $m^2$."
Our algorithm generates a transition system in the belief space
and uses local feedback controllers to break the {\em curse of history}
associated with belief space planning.
%Another benefit is that automata-based methods become tractable.
Furthermore, conventional automata-based methods become tractable.
Switching control policies are then computed using a product
Markov Decision Process (MDP) between
the transition system and the Rabin automaton encoding 
the task specification.
We present algorithms to translate a GDTL formula to a Rabin
automaton and to efficiently construct the product MDP
by leveraging recent results from incremental computing.
Our approach is evaluated in hardware experiments using
a camera network and ground robot.
