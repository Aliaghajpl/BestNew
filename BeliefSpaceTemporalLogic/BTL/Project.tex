\section{Meeting Notes} \label{sec:meetingNotes}

1) Ali/Kamak/Rohan
Set up meeting wiht Havard Grip
    -- Dynamics model
    -- Mission scenario (read Cristi's paper/ read this draft/ discuss with Ali)
Set up meeting MiMi Aung (lead of entire Mars Copter)
    -- further polish the scenario
    -- get feedback from her that we are on the right track the whole idea
    
2) Ali: staffing
Add Cristi to weekly meetings
Send email to Rich Murray regarding potential student
Ali is talking to three postdocs
Talk to Sertac/Cristi as a visiting post-doc
    -- it will help Cristi with his job process

From JPL:
Kamak (mission)
Rohan (software support for Cristi)
Kyon (best implementation -- 20percent of his time for 2018)
Oktay (not certain how much time spend)

Co-I:
Issa (mobility)
MiMi (Mars copter leader)
Lorrain (Autonomy/ Health-aware systems)

=======

Set up a meeting at Caltech next week (maybe Tues 10am)

Aaron is out of town ??-?? 

3) Rohan/Kamak
Supporting Cristi on the software
Embedding our scenario into his solver

\section{TODO List}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Get map for the environment [R]
  \item Convert to Finite-State-Machine [C]
  \item Update software to handle FSM [C]
  \item Define GDTL specification in paper, Add text [R]
  \item Write mission description language [R]
  \item Implement GDTL specs in Software, install spot [R]
  \item Write simple running example [C] *first cut
  \item Figure for product MDP [R]
  \item Handle remapping and re-planing
\end{enumerate} \

Ideas for Future Work:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Add unexplored region label in the map
  \item Use Rover Slip detection work from Oktay
  \item Tell copter where to go
\end{enumerate} \

Leverage Ali's FY17 work:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Learn how to assess the traversability of the (copter) unseen areas using rover's long-range images and HiRise images
  \item Use the "where to look paper" to assess the planning-relevant visual content in images
\end{enumerate} \

Planning methods for space exploration- a review:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Steve Chien: Casper, ASPEN, Using iterative Repair to Improve...
  \item Gregory Rabideau (implementer)
  \item Tables for 
\end{enumerate}
