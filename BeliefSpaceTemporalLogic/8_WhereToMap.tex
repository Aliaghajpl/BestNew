\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we consider the problem of planetary exploration with a two-agent team composed of a Mars rover and copter. Images by a copter can help estimation or navigation of a rover. In such a mission, how a copter learns where to map for a rover is of great interest in a two-agent team. 
This paper answers this where to map by a copter while minimizing uncertainty of images from a rover’s camera.

\section{Problem Description}
This section gives a formal definition of the problem we are going to address. 

\pr{Problem}
A two-agent team composed of a Mars rover and copter is considered. This paper automates the process of where to map by a copter in order to minimize the covariance or the localization belief of a rover while considering the copter’s body path.
Copter’s constraints coming from a battery is described as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Three flights per sol
    \item Two minutes per flight
\end{itemize}
 %Figure~\ref{fig:8_1} shows a belief propagation of a rover and Fig.~\ref{fig:8_2} illustrates an image of where to map by a copter. The copter can take images within the limitation of the battery at one step of the rover.
 
\pr{Rover and Helicopter Description}
The rover and helicopter configurations are denoted by $x^r$ and $x^c$, respectively. The extended state $x=(x^r,~x^c)$ includes both.

\pr{Rover and Helicopter Measurements}
Let $z^r_k$ and $z^c_k$ the measurements (images) by the rover and the copter at the $k$-th time step, respectively. Sequences of observations are defined as
\begin{align}
    z^r_{0:k}&=\{z^r_0,z^r_1,\cdots,z^r_k\}\\
    z^c_{k,1:j}&=\{z^c_{k,1},z^c_{k,2},\cdots,z^c_{k,j}\}
\end{align}
where $0 \leq k \leq T$ and a copter takes $j$ images at the $k$-th rover step.

\pr{Map Belief}
We denote the map of the environment by $m$ and assume the environment is stationary. The knowledge we have about the environment is obtained via noisy sensors. Therefore, the best we can have is a probabilistic representation of $m$, i.e., the map belief
\begin{align}
    b^m=p(m|z, x)
\end{align}

\pr{Measurement Model}
The measurement model describes the probability distribution over all possible observations given the robots' state $x$ and the environment map $m$.
\begin{align}
    p(z|m, x)
\end{align}

\section{Mapping}

\pr{Map Representation}
We consider maps from both rover and copter and use a surf feature mapping. Vectors or matrices $m^r$ and $m^c$ denote maps by a rover and a copter, respectively. Finally, a map can be obtained by combining $m^r$ and $m^c$.

\pr{Map Update}
The map of a rover and a copter can be updated as follows:
\begin{align}
    m^r_{k+1}&=\tau^r_m (m_k, x^r_{k+1}, z^r_{k+1})\\
    m^c_{k+1}&=\tau^c_m (m_k, x^c_{k+1}, z^c_{k+1})
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
    z^r_{k+1} &\sim p(\cdot |x^r_{k+1})\\
    x^r_{k+1} &\sim p(\cdot |x^r_k, u^r_k, w^r_k)\\
    z^c_{k+1} &\sim p(\cdot |x^c_{k+1})\\
    x^c_{k+1} &\sim p(\cdot |x^c_k, u^c_k, w^c_k).
\end{align}
Therefore, using these $m^r_{k+1}$ and $m^c_{k+1}$, the map at the $k$-th time step can be obtained by

\begin{eqnarray}
m_{k+1} =
  \begin{cases}
    \tau_m (m^r_{k+1}, m^c_{k+1}) & (k+1 = l)\\
    m^r_{k+1} & (k+1 \neq l)
  \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Rover Localization}
This section considers belief update for a rover localization. Belief update of a map is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
    b^{m}_k=
    \begin{cases}
    p(m_k | z^r_{0:k}, x^r_{0:k}, z^c_{k,1:j}, x^c_{k,1:j}) & (k=l)\\
    p(m_k | z^r_{0:k}, x^r_{0:k}) & (k \neq l)
    \end{cases}
\end{eqnarray}
Belief update of a rover localization is given by
\begin{align}
    b^r_{k+1}=\tau^r (b^r_k, b^m_k, u^r_k, z^r_{k+1}; m_{k+1}).
\end{align}

\section{Planning: copter where to map}
\subsection{Planning Objective}
%Covariance (Exploitation)\\

We find a helicopter position that minimizes the following cost function:
\begin{align}
    &x^{c*}=\arg\min_{x^c \in X^c} \sum^T_{k=1} P^{r+}_k\label{eq:c1}\\
     &{\rm s.t.} \hspace{5mm} D^c_{\min}(x^c_{alt}) \leq D^c_k \leq D^c_{\max}(x^c_{alt})\label{eq:st1}\\
    &\hspace{10mm} \sum^{n}_{i=0} L^c_{k,i} \leq L^c_{\max}(t^c_{search}), ~~0\leq i \leq n \label{eq:st2}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
P^{r+}_k&={\rm Cov}(x^{r+}_k) = {\rm Cov}(x^{r}_k | z^r_{0:k})\label{eq:p1}\\
&={\rm VO}(z^r_0,~z^r_1,\cdots,~z^r_k)\simeq {\rm VO}(z^r_k).\label{eq:p2}
\end{align}
Note that Cov($\cdot$) and VO($\cdot$) denote the covariance and the visual odometry, respectively.

\subsection{Constraints}

\pr{Resolution constraint}
A resolution of an image from a copter depends on a camera performance and a altitude of a copter $x^c_{alt}$.
%\begin{align}
%    \zeta=k x^c_{alt}
%\end{align}

\pr{Field-of-view constraint}
Equation~\eqref{eq:st1} represents the constraint that the area of the image depends on the altitude of the copter.
A field-of-view (FOV) $D^c$ is determined by an altitude of a copter.
\begin{align}
    D^c_{\min}(x^c_{alt}) \leq D^c_k \leq D^c_{\max}(x^c_{alt})
\end{align}

\pr{Flight time constraint}
Equation~\eqref{eq:st2} represents the constraint that the searching range $L^c$ depends on the flight time $t^c_{search}$ coming from the battery limitation of the copter.
\begin{align}
    \sum^{n}_{i=0} L^c_{k,i} \leq L^c_{\max}(t^c_{search})
\end{align}
where $n$ is the number of the areas for searching by the copter.

\pr{Flight interval constraint}
``{\it When to map}'' is also an interesting problem.

\subsection{Search Method}


\section{Planning: copter body path planning}
\subsection{Planning Objective}
Using the cost $C(b_k, u_k)$,
\begin{align}
    &u^{c*}_{0:k}=\arg\min_{x^c \in X^c} \mathbb{E} \sum^T_{k=0} C(b^r_k, u_k; m_k (u^c_{0:k}))\\
    &{\rm s.t.} \hspace{5mm} ||u^c_{0:k}||< \delta\label{eq:st10}\\
    &\hspace{10mm} x^r_T \in goal^r\label{eq:st20}
\end{align}

\subsection{Constraints}
\pr{Input constraint}
Equation~\eqref{eq:st10} represents the constraint that the limitation of the copter control input as follow:
\begin{align}
    ||u^c_{0:k}||< \delta
\end{align}

\pr{Position constraint}
Equation~\eqref{eq:st20} represents the constraint that the rover need to reach the goal at the final step $T$.
\begin{align}
    x^r_T \in goal^r
\end{align}

\subsection{Search Method}





\subsection{Search the optimal path}
From the obtained the areas to map, next we search the optimal path (shortest path) using a traveling salesman problem (TSP).
