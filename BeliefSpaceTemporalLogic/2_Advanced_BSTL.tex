\begin{abstract}
  As a step towards achieving autonomy in space exploration missions we consider a collaborative robotic system with a copter and a rover. The copter explores an unknown environment so as to maximize the probability that the rover can satisfy a science mission expressed in Linear Temporal Logic. We mitigate the curse of dimensionality for this large system by leveraging its decomposed nature, and demonstrate on hardware that the resulting policy makes intelligent decisions in the face of uncertainty.

\section{Introduction}

Map exploration and task planning are crucial aspects of any autonomous system. In most approaches, these two aspects are decoupled in the sense that exploration is done to maximize knowledge overall, rather than to maximize knowledge \emph{pertaining to the task}. In this work we aim to improve efficiency in situations where exploration is expensive by limiting exploration to areas crucial for achieving a given specification. 

We are motivated by autonomy in multi-asset robotics teams for space exploration, in particular the 2020 Mars mission that will consist of a ground rover and a copter for exploration (Fig. \ref{fig:heli-rover}). Autonomy is important in such a mission due to severe communication delays, and efficiency is desirable since resources like battery time and hours of sunlight are limited. In these missions partial knowledge about the environment is typically available from satellite imagery, but it needs to be complemented with observations from on-board sensors. By computing the most important areas to explore, the autonomy and efficiency of the team can be improved. 

Our approach lies at the intersection of formal synthesis methods and optimal control. The exploration problem can be phrased as a two-stage optimal control problem in the combined space of robot poses and environment beliefs. To partially circumvent the curse of dimensionality in the resulting large system we leverage its decomposed nature and do value iteration via sequential back stepping, which avoids construction of the overall system.

\section{Preliminaries}

Notation

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal P(\X)$: probability densities over $\X$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Markov Decision Processes}

A finite Markov decision processes is defined as follows \cite{hll1996}.
% \cite{mt1993,bertsekas2004stochastic}.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:MDP}
  A discrete-time \textbf{Markov decision process} (MDP) is a tuple $\MDP = (\X, \init, \tr, \U)$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\X$ is a (finite) state space with states $x\in\X$; % as its elements;
    \item $\init \in \mathcal P(\X)$ is an initial probability distribution;
    \item $\U$ is a (finite) input space with inputs $u\in\U$;
    \item $\tr$ is a conditional stochastic kernel that assigns to each state $x\in \X$ and control $u\in \U$ a probability density $\tr(\cdot\mid x,u)$ over $\X$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

An \emph{execution} of $\MDP$ is a state-input sequence $(x_0, u_0)(x_1, u_1)\ldots$ where $x_0 \sim \rho$ and $x_{k+1} \sim \tr(\cdot \mid x_k, u_k)$ for inputs $u_k \in \U$. A \emph{policy} $\pol = \pol_0 \pol_1 \ldots$ is a sequence of conditional probability distributions $\pol_k( \cdot \mid x_0, \ldots, x_{k})$. We say that a policy is \emph{Markov} if $\pol_k( \cdot \mid x_0, \ldots, x_{k}) = \pol_k( \cdot \mid x_{k})$ for all $k$. If a trajectory is such that $u_k \sum \pol_k ( \cdot \mid x_0, \ldots, x_{k})$ we say that the trajectory is \emph{generated} by $\pol$.

\subsection{Specifications}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Something about atomic propositions (and examples)
\end{itemize}

Consider a set $AP = \{ p_1, \ldots, p_L \}$ of atomic propositions; it defines an \emph{alphabet} $\alphabet$ where each \emph{letter} $\letter$ of the alphabet is defined as a set of atomic propositions. An infinite string of letters is a \emph{word} $\word=\letter_0\letter_1\letter_2\ldots\in\alphabet^{\mathbb{N}}$.

To quantify the dynamic behavior of a system, we define the word associated to an MDP execution. Consider a labeling function $\lab: \X \rightarrow \alphabet$ that maps states to letters in the alphabet. The words generated by a belief trajectory $\mathbf{x} = x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots$ can be defined as the word $\word = \lab(x_0)\lab(x_1) \lab(x_2) \ldots$. System properties can now be expressed via temporal logic formulas over the generated words.

Properties are formulas composed of atomic propositions and operators. In the sequel we focus on a fragment of linear temporal logic. 
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:gdtl-syntax}
  Formulas in the \textbf{syntactically co-safe LTL} (scLTL) fragment are constructed according to the grammar
  \begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:scLTL}
    \psi =  \True \ |\ p \ |\ \lnot p \ |\ \psi_1 \vee\psi_2  \ |\ \psi_1 \land \psi_2 \ |\ \psi_1 \ltluntil \psi_2 \ |\ \ltlnext \psi,
  \end{equation*}
  where $p\in \AP$ is an atomic proposition.
\end{definition}

% The syntax defines the symbols and their correct ordering to form a formulae.
To define the interpretation of a formula, i.e. the \emph{semantics}, consider a word $\word$.

\begin{definition}
 The \textbf{semantics} of scLTL are defined recursively as follows: $\word$ \textbf{satisfies} $\psi$ at time $k$, written $(\word, k) \models \psi$, if
 \begin{itemize}
    \item $(\word, k) \models \True$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models p$ iff $p \in \letter_k$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \psi_1 \land  \psi_2  $ iff $ ( (\word, k) \models \psi_1 ) \land ( (\word, k) \models \psi_2 ) $;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \psi_1 \lor  \psi_2  $ iff $ ( (\word, k) \models \psi_1 ) \lor ( (\word, k) \models \psi_2 ) $;
    \item $(\word, k) \models  \psi_1 \ltluntil \psi_2 $ iff $\exists j \geq k \text{ s.t. } ((\word, j) \models \psi_2 ) $ and $(\word, l) \models \psi_1, \forall l \in \{k, \ldots j-1\}$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \ltlnext \psi$ iff $(\word, k+1) \models \psi$.
 \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

We say that a trajectory $\mathbf{x} = x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots$ satisfies a specification $\psi$, written $\mathbf{x} \models \psi$, if the generated word $\word =\lab(x_0) \lab(x_1) \lab(x_2) \ldots$ satisfies $\psi$ at time 0, i.e. $\word_0 \models \psi$.


\section{Problem Statement}

A common way to represent a map for planning purposes is to attach labels such as ``sand'' or ``rock'' to different locations. Uncertainty in the environment can then be captured with MDPs $\MDP_{e_i}$ that model belief dynamics over labels. Transitions occur when measurements are taken from on-board sensors, i.e. the robots need to be physically close to a region to determine its labels. 

Belief MDPs can then be combined with models of robots that can move around and take measurements, resulting in systems such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:robot-env}. In an uncertain environment satisfaction of a given specification is a function of the true environment, and thus stochastic. Our objective is to extract control policies that maximize the knowledge about the satisfiability of a given task, in particular we seek to minimize the entropy of the Bernoilli random variable corresponding to specification satisfaction. Minimizing the entropy promotes both exploration that leads to high confidence that the specification can be satisfied, but also exploration that potentially shows that the task can not be satisfied. Also the latter is a desirable outcome as it admits resources to be redirected towards feasible objectives.

\end{figure}

\begin{problem}
\label{prob:main}
  Consider MDP models of robots model $\MDP_{r_1}$ and $\MDP_{r_2}$ and MDP models for environment belief dynamics $\MDP_{e_1}, \ldots \MDP_{e_n}$, together with a task $\varphi$ for $\MDP_1$ expressed in scLTL. Design a policy $\pol^1$ for $\MDP_{r_1}$ and a policy $\pol^2$ for $\MDP_{r_2}$ such that for the resulting executions $\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, \mathbf{e}$,
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:probstatement}
    - \Prob_\init^\pol ( (\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{e}) \models \varphi ) \log \left( \Prob_\init^\pol ( (\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{e}) \models \varphi ) \right)
  \end{equation}
  is minimized.
\end{problem}

An advantage of considering the scLTL fragment is that policy synthesis for a scLTL specification over a space $\X$ is equivalent to reachability of $\X\times Q_f$ on the product system $\MDP \otimes_{ser} \FSA_\psi$, where $\FSA_\varphi$ is a finite-state automaton constructed from $\varphi$ \cite{Belta2017} with accepting set $Q_f$. A finite-state automaton is a special case of an MDP, thus also the product system is an MDP. It is well known that reachability probability can be computed via value iteration of a Bellman operator \cite{Baier2008}. In the next section we discuss value iteration for the type of product MDPs we are interested in, and show that there is no need to compute the aggregate systems.


\section{Sequential Value Iteration}
\label{sec:sequential_val_iter}


\subsection{Networks of MDPs}

We first define two types of products between two MDPs $\MDP_1 = (\X_1, \init_1, \U_1, \tr_1)$ and $\MDP_2 = (\X_2, \init_2, \U_2, \tr_2)$: serial and parallel products.
\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{parallel product} of $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$ is the MDP $\MDP_1 \otimes_{par} \MDP_2 = (\X_1 \times \X_2, \init_{par}, \U_1 \times \U_2, \tr_{par})$, where
  \begin{equation}
    \init_{par}(x_1, x_2) = \init_1(x_1) \init_2(x_2)
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
      \tr_{par}&(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, u_1, u_2) \\
      & = \tr_1 (x_1' \mid x_1, u_1) \tr_2 (x_2' \mid x_2, u_2)
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given a \textbf{connection} $C : \X_1 \rightarrow \U_2$, the \textbf{serial product} of $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$ is the MDP $\MDP_1 \otimes_{ser}^C \MDP_2 = (\X_1 \times \X_2, \init_{ser}, \U_1, \tr_{ser})$,
  where
  \begin{equation}
    \init_{ser}(x_1, x_2) = \init_1(x_1) \init_2(x_2)
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
      \tr_{ser}&(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, u_1) \\
      & = \tr_1 (x_1' \mid x_1, u_1) \tr_2 (x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1') )
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
In a parallel product there is no interaction between the two MDPs. Conversely, in a serial product a transition $x_1 \rightarrow x_1'$ in $\MDP_1$ triggers an action $C(x_1')$ in $\MDP_2$ that results in a transition in $x_2' \sim T_2(\cdot \mid x_2, C(x_1'))$

Both products can be generalized to more than two components and products can also be nested: e.g. $\MDP_1 \otimes_{ser}^C \left( \MDP_2 \otimes_{par} \MDP_3 \right)$. Large nested products lead to large state spaces, and since the size of the transition matrix is quadratic in the size of the state space, computation of the aggregate transition matrix quickly becomes challenging. However, we next show that value iteration can be done sequentially over subsystems without computing the aggregate transition matrices.


\subsection{Sequential Iteration of Bellman Operator}

Given a function $g: \X \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, consider a general Bellman operator $\bellman : (\X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+) \rightarrow (\X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+)$ on the following form:
\begin{equation}
  (\bellman V) (x) = \max_{\pol \in (\X \rightarrow \U)} \sum_{x' \in \X}  g(x', V(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x)).
\end{equation}
The optimal value function $V^*$ and policy $\pol^*$ for a given bellman operator $\bellman$ is then found via the iterations
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:value_iter}
  \begin{align}
    & V^*_0 \equiv 0, \\
    & V^*_{k+1}  = \bellman V_k \label{eq:iter}, \\
    & \pol^* \in \argmax_{\pol \in (\X \rightarrow \U)} \sum_{x' \in \X}  g(x', V^*(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x)).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{example}
  For the Bellman operator corresponding to reaching a set $X_f$, the function $g$ is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    g(x', v') = \max( \ind_{X_f}(x'), v').
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the finite-horizon optimal control problem 
  \begin{equation}
     \max \sum_{t=0}^T J_t(x_t).
  \end{equation} 
  In this case, if the dynamic programming is initialized with $V_T(x) = J_T(x)$, iterated applications of the Bellman operator corresponding to $g_t(x', v') = J_{t-1}(x') + v'$, i.e.
  \begin{equation*}
    V_{t-1}(x) = \bellman_t V_{t} (x) = \max_{\pol} (J_{t-1}(x') + V_{t}(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x))
  \end{equation*}
  computes the value function at times $T-1, T-2, \ldots, 0$.
\end{example}

We now consider the Bellman iteration product MDPs. For a serial product we get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  \bellman V (x_1, x_2) & = \max_{\pol: (\X_1 \times \X_2 \rightarrow \U_1)} \sum_{x_1', x_2' \in \X_1 \times \X_2}  g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) \\
  & \quad \times T_{ser}(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, \pol(x_1, x_2)) \\
  & = \max_{\pol: (\X_1 \times \X_2 \rightarrow \U_1)} \sum_{x_1' \in \X_1} T_1(x_1' \mid x_1, \pol(x_1, x_2)) \\
  & \quad \times \sum_{x_2' \in \X_2}  g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) T_2(x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1')).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
It follows that the Bellman update $V \mapsto \bellman V$ for a serial product can be computed sequentially as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  W_2(x_1', x_2') & = g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) \\
  W_1(x_1', x_2) & = \sum_{x_2' \in \X_2}  T_2(x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1')) W_2(x_1', x_2'), \\
  \bellman V(x_1, x_2) & = \max_{\pol} \sum_{x_1' \in \X_1} T_1(x_1' \mid x_1, \pol(x_1, x_2)) W_1(x_1', x_2).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
The procedure generalizes immediately to $n$-length serial products and the sequential updates
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:general_decomp}
\begin{aligned}
  & W_{i-1}(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_i, \ldots, x_n) \\
  & \quad = \sum_{x_{i}' \in \X_{i}} \left[ \begin{aligned} & T_{i} (x_{i}' \mid x_{i}, C(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}')) \\ 
   & \times W_{i} (x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_k', \ldots, x_n)
    \end{aligned} \right].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{remark}
  In serial products of arbitrary length a connection $C_i$ can be defined either as $C_i: \X_{i-1} \rightarrow \U_i$, or as $C_i: \X_1 \times \ldots \times \X_{i-1} \rightarrow \U_i$. In the latter case the connection potentially becomes a non-sparse object.
\end{remark}

In addition, if $\MDP_{i+1}$ is itself a serial or parallel product, \eqref{eq:general_decomp} can again be decomposed. If for instance $\MDP_{i} = \MDP_{i_1} \otimes_{par} \MDP_{i_2}$ is a parallel product we can write $x_i = (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2})$ and \eqref{eq:general_decomp} can be computed as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  & W_{i_1}(x_1', \ldots, (x_{i_1}', x_{i_2}), \ldots, x_n) \\
  & \quad = \sum_{x_{i_2}' \in \X_{i_2}} T_{i_2}(x_{i_2}' \mid x_{i_2}, C(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}') ), \\
  & W_{i-1}(x_1', \ldots, (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}), \ldots, x_n) \\
  & \quad = \sum_{x_{i_1}' \in \X_{i_1}} T_{i_1}(x_{i_1}' \mid x_{i_1}, C(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}') ). \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
As a consequence, for any aggregate system constructed from serial and parallel products, iterative value function computation for this type of Bellman operator can be performed without explicitly computing aggregate transition probabilities. The sequential approach is advantageous when the connections are sparse, i.e. the connection mappings $C$ can be compactly represented.

\begin{remark}
  The difference between sequential value iteration and centralized value iteration can be illustrated in tensor notation. Let $T_{u_i x_i}^{x_i'}$ be the transition matrix for system $i$ and let $U_{x'_{i-1}}^{u_i} = \ind_{C_{i-1}(x'_{i-1}) = u_i}$, then sequential computation is as follows:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tensor_sequential}
  \begin{aligned}
      & W_{x_1' \ldots, x_n'} = g(x_1', \ldots, x_n', V_{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}) \\
      & \text{for $k = n, n-1, \ldots, 2$}: \\
      & \quad W_{x_1'\ldots x_{k-1}' x_{k} \ldots x_n} = U_{x_{k-1}}^{u_k} T_{u_k x_k}^{x_k'}  W_{x_1'\ldots x_k' x_{k+1} \ldots x_n'} \quad \\
      & V_{x_1\ldots x_n} = \max_{u_1} T^{x_1'}_{u_1x_1} W_{x_1' x_2 \ldots x_n}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  This can be contrasted with the naive approach where one first constructs the aggregate transition tensor $T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}$ and then computes
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tensor_naive}
    V_{x_1, \ldots x_n} = \max_{u_1} T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'} g(x_1', \ldots, x_n', V_{x_1', \ldots x_n'}).
  \end{equation}
  Eq \eqref{eq:tensor_naive} involves the same number of multiplications as \eqref{eq:tensor_sequential}, but the expensive construction of $T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}$ is avoided in \eqref{eq:tensor_sequential}.

    \label{fig:scalability}
  \end{figure}
\begin{example}
  We demonstrate the advantage of sequential value iteration with a numerical example. We consider $k$-length serial products of MDPs with two actions and six states each; the total number of states in such a product is $6^k$. For increasing values of $k$ we compute the probability of reaching a certain part of the state space by sequential value iteration, and by naively forming the overall transitions matrices. Figure \ref{fig:scalability} illustrates the computation time for increasing values of $k$ over 10 trials. As can be seen, the advantage of sequential value iteration over the naive approach is significant.

\subsection{Sparse Value Function via Tensor Decomposition}

In the previous subsection we outlined how Bellman iterations for a value function can be performed sequentially in product systems. However, a dense value function representation is still of size $\mathcal O (|\X_1| |\X_2|)$ which can constitute a bottleneck for large products. In this section we explore how computational efficiency can be improved by using sparse value function representations. The cost is a loss of precision and guarantees with respect to the final value function.

Possible sparse representations
\begin{itemize}
  \item CP representation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: can be mapped through CP linear operators via ALS
    \item Con: value iteration is nonlinear
    \item What about policy iteration with sparse policy? 
  \end{itemize}
  \item TT representation
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: Black-box cross algorithm to approximate tensor via sampling
    \item Con: No analysis, brute force
  \end{itemize}
  \item Serial-parts, e.g. $V^1_{x_r e_1 \phi} \ldots V^n_{x_r e_n \phi}$
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pro: May be suited to problem
    \item Con: Don't know how to update components, convergence not understood
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Related work}

A generalization of serial and parallel products are \emph{factored MDPs} \cite{Boutilier2000}. In a factored MDP with local states $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ the state update for $x_i$ only depends on the \emph{scope} $C_i$, i.e. $T(x_i \mid x) = T(x_i \mid x_j, j \in C_i)$. Evidently, this structure encompasses parallel and serial products: in a serial product $C_i = \{ i-1, i \}$, whereas in a parallel product $C_i = \{ i \}$. The value function for a factored MDP is not necessarily sparse; a reasonable approach is therefore to resort to approximate methods and represent the value function as a linear combination of factored basis functions. Approximate algorithms for the standard reward-maximizing problem include \cite{Guestrin2003} for approximate policy iteration and approximate linear programming, and \cite{Szita2008} for approximate value iteration. Other work utilizes symbolic representations to improve scalability \cite{Boutilier2000}.

We consider a two-asset mission consisting of a ground rover and a flying copter 

\subsection{Problem setup}

\paragraph{Abstract Robot Models}

We denote the location of robot and copter with $x_r \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $x_c \in \mathbb{R}^3$. For a given domain $\X_r \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\X_c \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ we introduce abstract states $\xi_r \in [\X_r]_{N_{rx}, N_{ry}}$ and $\xi_d \in [\X_c]_{N_{cx}, N_{cy}, N_{cz}}$, where e.g. $N_{rx}$ is the number of discrete states along the $x$ axis. 

We assume that both robots freely can move east, north, west, or south between the discrete states while remaining in the workspace, and that the copter can additionally adjust its elevation by moving up and down. With these assumptions we can model the rover with an MDP $\MDP_{rov}$ with $N_{rx} N_{ry}$ states and $4$ inputs, and the copter as an MDP $\MDP_{copt}$ with $N_{cx} N_{cy} N_{cz}$ states and $6$ inputs. In the following we fix $N_{rx} = N_{ry} = N_{cx} = N_{cy} = 10$ and $N_{cz} = 2$, i.e. both robots move on a 10x10 grid in 2D space, and the copter can fly at two different altitudes (in the following referred to as \emph{high} and \emph{low}).

\paragraph{Low-level Robot Controllers}

How quadrotors are controlled to move between discrete states.

  \label{fig:envmdp}
\end{figure}

We assume that regions of interest have been extracted from low-resolution satellite imagery, along with prior probability estimates for the likelihood that the regions exhibit certain traits. Here we restrict attention to \emph{risk regions} that may contain obstacles the rover can not traverse, and \emph{target regions} that are likely places where scientific samples can be extracted. We associate to each region $R_i$ a belief MDP $\MDP_{R_i}$ with five states $\zeta_i \in \{ 0, p^i_-, p^i_0, p^i_+, 1\}$ and three inputs $v_i \in \{ N, W, S \}$ for (N)o measurement, (W)eak measurement, and (S)trong measurement. The transition matrices are $T_N = I_5$, 
\begin{equation}
  T_{S} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0   \\
    \bar p_- &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_- \\
    \bar p_0 &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_0 \\
    \bar p_+ &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_+ \\
    0        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right],
  T_{W} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1        &  0                &  0  &  0           &  0   \\
    q\bar p_-&  \bar q \bar p_-  &  0  &  \bar q p_-  &  q p_- \\
    q\bar p_0&  \bar q \bar p_0  &  0  &  \bar q p_0  &  q p_0 \\
    q\bar p_+&  \bar q \bar p_+  &  0  &  \bar q p_+  &  q p_+ \\
    0        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right].
\end{equation}
Here $q$ is a parameter denoting the quality of the weak measurement: if $q=0$ weak measurements are incapable of determining the true nature of the region, only intermediate beliefs $p_-$ and $p_+$ can be reached. For $q \in (0,1]$ there is a probability of a transition to a belief state 0 or 1. The outgoing transitions from $p_0$ are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:envmdp}.

Given belief MDPs $\MDP_{R_i}$ for every region of interest, we construct the environment model $M_{env}$ as the parallel product
\begin{equation}
  \MDP_{env} = \MDP_{R_1} \otimes_{par} \MDP_{R_1}  \otimes_{par} \ldots \otimes_{par} \MDP_{R_n}. 
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Specification}

The objective of the mission is to satisfy a scLTL specification $\varphi$ over propositions over states in $\MDP_{rov}$ and $\MDP_{env}$. Examples of such propositions include
\begin{itemize}
  \item Don't enter a risk region $R_1$ that may contain an obstacle: $\xi_r \not  \in R_1 \lor \xi_1 = 0$.
  \item Collect a sample at region $R_2$: $\xi_r \in R_2 \land \xi_2 = 1$.
\end{itemize}

We posit that the rover has a time window of length $T_r$ to fulfill its mission, and that the copter has battery sufficient to operate for a time $T_c$. In addition, the copter must land in a pre-designated landing area $X_l$ at the end of the execution. Given these constraints, the challenge is to find strategies for both the copter and rover that maximize the probability that the science specification is fulfilled.


\subsection{Turn-based solution}

We decouple the problem by letting the copter execute first, followed by the rover. The goal of the copter is then one of exploring the uncertain environment in a way that maximizes knowledge about the satisfiability of the rover task. To solve this problem via sequential value iteration we convert the scLTL specification into a DFSA $\MDP_{\varphi}$ and consider the following two product systems:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  \MDP_{1} &= \left( \MDP_{rov} \otimes_{ser} \MDP_{env} \right) \otimes_{ser} \MDP_{\varphi}, \\
  \MDP_{2} &= \MDP_{cop} \otimes_{ser} \MDP_{env}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The serial connections are defined via connections that map the state of one system to the input of the next. These connections are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the rover is adjacent to a region $R_i$ it triggers a (S)trong measurement of that region,
  \item If the copter is at low altitude and in region $R_i$, it triggers a (S)trong measurement of that region,
  \item If the copter is at high altitude and within distance $2$ of region $R_i$, it triggers a (W)eak measurement of that region,
  \item The connection between the $\MDP_{rov} \otimes_{ser} \MDP_{env}$ product and $\MDP_{\varphi}$ is given by the truth value of atomic propositions for the state $(\xi_r, \xi_e)$.
\end{itemize}
Figure \ref{fig:agg} illustrates the two systems. We assume that the initial position $\xi_r^0$ of the rover is known, and let $\xi_\varphi^0$ be the initial state of the specification automaton. We propose the following two-step solution:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $\xi_1 = (\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$ let $g(\xi_1', v') = \max( \ind_{X_f}(\xi_\varphi'), v' )$ and compute the value functions $V^1_t(\xi_1)$ for $t = T_r, T_r-1 \ldots, 0$ via the Bellman iterations
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:valit1}
  \begin{aligned}
      V^1_{T_r}(\xi_1) & = g(\xi_1, 0), \\
      V^1_{t-1} (\xi_1) & = \max_{u_r} \sum_{\xi_1'} T(\xi_1' \mid \xi_1, u_r) g(\xi_1', V_t(\xi_1')).
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation} 
  \item For $\xi_2 = (\xi_c, \xi_e)$, compute the value functions $V^2_t(\xi_2)$ for $t = T_c, T_c-1, \ldots, 0$ via the Bellman iterations
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:valit2}
  \begin{aligned}
    V_{T_c}^2(\xi_2) & = \ind_{X_l} (\xi_c) \times V^1_0(\xi_r^0, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi^0), \\
    V_{t-1}^2(\xi_2) & = \max_{u_c} \sum_{\xi_2'} T(\xi_2' \mid \xi_2, u_c) V^2_t(\xi_2').
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
The interpretation of these value functions are as follows: $V_t^1(\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$ is the probability that the rover will satisfy its mission if at time $t$ the state of $\MDP_1$ is $(\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$. The copter is tasked with minimizing the entropy at the initial states $\xi_r^0, \xi_\varphi^0$ that the rover \emph{can not affect}, by updating the belief $\xi_e$ that it \emph{can affect} via environment exploration in the way most beneficial for task knowledge. In addition, the requirement that the rover must be in the landing zone $X_l$ at time $T_c$ has been incorporated in the value function. Thus, $V_t^2(x_c, x_e)$ represents the probability that the rover will have a successful execution, and that the copter can land in $X_l$, if the copter-environment state at time $t$ is $(x_c, x_e)$. In addition to the value functions, time-dependent policies that maximize the value functions can be extracted as the maximizing argument.

Both iterations \eqref{eq:valit1} and \eqref{eq:valit2} fall within the framework of sequential value iteration for parallel and serial products in Section \ref{sec:sequential_val_iter}. As a consequence there is no need to construct the aggregate transition matrices for $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$.


\subsection{Illustrations}

We demonstrate the features of the proposed solution in a few example scenarios.

\paragraph{Scenario 1} Collect one sample of type $A$ and one sample of type $B$ while avoiding obstacles:
\begin{equation*}
  \left( \lnot \texttt{obstacle} \; \mathcal U \; \texttt{sampleA} \right) \land \left( \lnot \texttt{obstacle} \; \mathcal U \; \texttt{sampleB} \right)
\end{equation*}
The maximum execution lengths are 15 for the rover and 20 for the copter, and the copter must return to its initial state at the end of its execution. Figure \ref{fig:workspace1} illustrates the workspace and Figure \ref{fig:values1} the resulting value functions. In this environment, the success probability for the rover is 12.4\% if copter-aided exploration is not available, as reflected by the purple color in the lower left corner of Figure \ref{fig:values1}. However, copter exploration lifts the success probability to 29.4\%. Note that this is the probability of success without assuming any additional information about the environment---the joint probability that a sample of type $A$ exists and that sample $B$ can be accessed is $0.64 \times 0.75 = 0.48$, which is thus an upper bound on the success probability of this mission. The increased success probability is solely due to the fact that the copter can explore, thus alleviating the rover from having to guess the true nature of the environment.
