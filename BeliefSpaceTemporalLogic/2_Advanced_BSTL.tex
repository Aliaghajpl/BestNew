\begin{abstract}
  As a step towards achieving autonomy in space exploration missions we consider a collaborative robotics system with a copter and a rover. The goal of the copter is to explore an unknown environment so as to maximize the probability that the rover can satisfy a science mission expressed in Linear Temporal Logic. We formulate the problem as a two-step dynamical program and mitigate the curse of dimensionality for this large system by leveraging its decomposed nature. We demonstrate in simulations and on hardware that the resulting policy makes intelligent decisions in the face of uncertainty.

\section{Introduction}

Map exploration and task planning are components aspects of any autonomous system. In most approaches, these two aspects are decoupled in the sense that exploration is performed to maximize knowledge overall, rather than to maximize knowledge \emph{pertaining to the task}. In this work we aim to improve efficiency in situations where exploration is expensive by limiting exploration to areas crucial for achieving a given task. 

We are motivated by autonomy in multi-asset robotics teams for space exploration, in particular the 2020 Mars mission that will consist of a ground rover and a copter for exploration (Fig. \ref{fig:heli-rover}). Autonomy is important due to severe communication delays, and efficiency is desirable since resources like battery time and hours of sunlight are limited. In these missions partial knowledge about the environment is typically available from satellite imagery, but it needs to be complemented with observations from on-board sensors. Our goal is to improve both autonomy and efficiency in such missions by developing principled methods that in a specification-guided manner determine the most important areas to explore. 

Our approach lies at the intersection of formal synthesis methods and optimal control. The exploration problem can be phrased as a two-stage optimal control problem in the combined space of robot poses and environment beliefs. To partially circumvent the curse of dimensionality in the resulting large system we leverage its decomposed nature and perform value iteration via sequential back stepping, which avoids construction of the overall system.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textcolor{red}{Short review of state-of-the-art mapping methods}
\end{itemize}

Three principal methods exist to solve stochastic optimal control problems: value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming \cite{Bertsekas1978}. Unfortunately, all three methods are limited to finite-state systems of moderate size. For systems with continuous state spaces, or systems that are very large, approaches include approximate dynamic programming (also known as reinforcement learning) \cite{Powell2011} and abstraction-based methods \cite{Zamani2015,Haesaert2017}. Approximate solutions methods to the stochastic optimal control problem under temporal logic constraints have been proposed via parametrized value function approximations \cite{Papusha2016,Leong2016}, and via tensor decompositions \cite{Alora2016}. While the above mentioned approaches are general in scope, we focus on uncertainty stemming from an unknown environment which we model in a way that leads to a naturally decomposed problem.

\subsection{Paper layout}

The following Section \ref{sec:preliminaries} introduces pertinent notation along with basics of probabilistic systems and temporal logics. Subsequently, Section \ref{sec:problem} introduces the problem we seek to solve, with our proposed solution in Section \ref{sec:solution}. We demonstrate the approach in a Mars-inspired case study in Section \ref{sec:casestudy}, and report experiments performed on our hardware implementation in Section \ref{sec:hardware}. The paper is concluded in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:preliminaries}

Notation

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal P(\X)$: probability distributions over $\X$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Markov Decision Processes}

A finite Markov decision processes is defined as follows \cite{hll1996}.
% \cite{mt1993,bertsekas2004stochastic}.
\begin{definition}
\label{def:MDP}
  A discrete-time \textbf{Markov decision process} (MDP) is a tuple $\MDP = (\X, \init, \tr, \U)$ where
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $\X$ is a (finite) state space with states $x\in\X$; % as its elements;
    \item $\init \in \mathcal P(\X)$ is an initial probability distribution; \sofie{Needed? we could give a fixed initial condition.}
    \item $\U$ is a (finite) input space with inputs $u\in\U$;
    \item $\tr$ is a conditional stochastic kernel that assigns to each state $x\in \X$ and control $u\in \U$ a probability distribution $\tr(\cdot\mid x,u)$ over $\X$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

An \emph{execution} of $\MDP$ is a state-input sequence $(x_0, u_0)(x_1, u_1)\ldots$ where $x_0 \sim \rho$ and $x_{k+1} \sim \tr(\cdot \mid x_k, u_k)$ for inputs $u_k \in \U$. A \emph{policy} $\pol = \pol_0 \pol_1 \ldots$ is a sequence of conditional probability distributions $\pol_k( \cdot \mid x_0, \ldots, x_{k})$. We say that a policy is \emph{Markov} if $\pol_k( \cdot \mid x_0, \ldots, x_{k}) = \pol_k( \cdot \mid x_{k})$ for all $k$. If a trajectory $(x_0, u_0)(x_1, u_1)\ldots$ is such that $u_k \sim \pol_k ( \cdot \mid x_{k})$ we say that the trajectory is \emph{generated} by $\pol$.

\subsection{Specifications}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Something about atomic propositions (and examples)
\end{itemize}

Consider a set $AP = \{ p_1, \ldots, p_L \}$ of atomic propositions; it defines an \emph{alphabet} $\alphabet$ where each \emph{letter} $\letter$ of the alphabet is defined as a set of atomic propositions. An infinite string of letters is a \emph{word} $\word=\letter_0\letter_1\letter_2\ldots\in\alphabet^{\mathbb{N}}$.

To quantify the dynamic behavior of a system, we define the word associated to an MDP execution. Consider a labeling function $\lab: \X \rightarrow \alphabet$ that maps states to letters in the alphabet. The words generated by a trajectory $\mathbf{x} = x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots$ can be defined as the word $\word = \lab(x_0)\lab(x_1) \lab(x_2) \ldots$. System properties can now be expressed via temporal logic formulas over the generated words.

Properties are formulas composed of atomic propositions and operators. In the sequel we focus on a fragment of linear temporal logic. 
\begin{definition}
  \label{def:gdtl-syntax}
  Formulas in the \textbf{syntactically co-safe LTL} (scLTL) fragment are constructed according to the grammar
  \begin{equation*}
    \label{eq:scLTL}
    \psi =  \True \ |\ p \ |\ \lnot p \ |\ \psi_1 \vee\psi_2  \ |\ \psi_1 \land \psi_2 \ |\ \psi_1 \ltluntil \psi_2 \ |\ \ltlnext \psi,
  \end{equation*}
  where $p\in \AP$ is an atomic proposition.
\end{definition}

% The syntax defines the symbols and their correct ordering to form a formulae.
To define the interpretation of a formula, i.e. the \emph{semantics}, consider a word $\word$.

\begin{definition}
 The \textbf{semantics} of scLTL are defined recursively as follows: $\word$ \textbf{satisfies} $\psi$ at time $k$, written $(\word, k) \models \psi$, if
 \begin{itemize}
    \item $(\word, k) \models \True$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models p$ iff $p \in \letter_k$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \psi_1 \land  \psi_2  $ iff $ ( (\word, k) \models \psi_1 ) \land ( (\word, k) \models \psi_2 ) $;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \psi_1 \lor  \psi_2  $ iff $ ( (\word, k) \models \psi_1 ) \lor ( (\word, k) \models \psi_2 ) $;
    \item $(\word, k) \models  \psi_1 \ltluntil \psi_2 $ iff $\exists j \geq k \text{ s.t. } ((\word, j) \models \psi_2 ) $ and $(\word, l) \models \psi_1, \forall l \in \{k, \ldots j-1\}$;
    \item $(\word, k) \models \ltlnext \psi$ iff $(\word, k+1) \models \psi$.
 \end{itemize}

\end{definition}

We say that a trajectory $\mathbf{x} = x_0 x_1 x_2 \ldots$ satisfies a specification $\psi$, written $\mathbf{x} \models \psi$, if the generated word $\word =\lab(x_0) \lab(x_1) \lab(x_2) \ldots$ satisfies $\psi$ at time 0, i.e. $\word_0 \models \psi$.


\section{Problem Setup}
\label{sec:problem}

A common way to represent a map for planning purposes is to attach labels such as ``sand'' or ``rock'' to different locations. Uncertainty in the environment can then be captured with MDPs $\MDP_{e_i}$ that model belief dynamics over labels. Transitions occur when measurements are taken from on-board sensors, i.e. the robots need to be physically close to a region to determine its labels. 

Belief MDPs can then be combined with models of robots that can move around and take measurements, resulting in systems such as the one in Figure \ref{fig:robot-env}. In an uncertain environment satisfaction of a given specification is a function of the true environment, and thus stochastic. Our objective is to extract control policies that maximize the knowledge about the satisfiability of a given task, in particular we seek to minimize the entropy of the Bernoilli random variable corresponding to specification satisfaction. Minimizing the entropy promotes both exploration that leads to high confidence that the specification can be satisfied, but also exploration that potentially shows that the task can not be satisfied. Also the latter is a desirable outcome as it admits resources to be redirected towards feasible objectives.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Illustration of a cooperative robotics system with two robots that can affect the belief states of environment labels via measurements.}
  \label{fig:robot-env}
\end{figure}

To make things more concrete, consider the following components:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A finite MDP $\MDP_{rov}$ modeling a ground rover in 2D space.
	\item A finite MDP $\MDP_{copt}$ modeling a copter in 3D space.
	\item A finite MDP $\MDP_{env}$ that captures belief dynamics over unknown environment labels.
	\item A measurement model that dictates how the state of $\MDP_{env}$ is updated from measurements received from the rover and copter. For instance, it is reasonable to assume that the rover can take measurements of a given region provided that it is sufficiently close, and that the copter can take measurements regions it flies above. Copter measurements depend on the altitude: a high-flying copter can see a larger area but the image resolution is better if the copter is close to the ground.    
\end{enumerate}

We can not state the type of question we attempt to answer in this paper.
\begin{problem}
\label{prob:main}
  Consider the model components listed above. For a given scLTL specification $\varphi$ that specifies a rover task, design a policy for the copter that explores the environment in a way that maximizes the knowledge about specification satisfaction.
\end{problem}

An advantage of considering the scLTL fragment is that policy synthesis for a scLTL specification over a space $\X$ is equivalent to reachability of $\X\times Q_f$ on the product system $\MDP \otimes_{ser} \FSA_\psi$, where $\FSA_\varphi$ is a finite-state automaton constructed from $\varphi$ \cite{Belta2017} with accepting set $Q_f$. A finite-state automaton is a special case of an MDP, thus also the product system is an MDP. It is well known that reachability probability can be computed via value iteration of a Bellman operator \cite{Baier2008}. In the next section we discuss value iteration for the type of product MDPs we are interested in, and show that there is no need to compute the aggregate systems.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Remark that we consider finite systems, but that ideas can be extended with appropriate measurability assumptions
\end{itemize}


\section{Specification-Guided Exploration via Two-Stage Dynamic Programming}
\label{sec:solution}

Due to the nature of the problem (the copter is quick and has short battery life, the rover is slow), it is reasonable to consider a turn-based solution, as we outline in Section \ref{sub:decompose}. In the statement of Problem \ref{prob:main} we were vague about what ``maximizing knowledge'' means, we discuss this further in Section \ref{sub:information} and give different options that may be desirable in different situations. Our proposed solution method requires value iteration over large MDPs. In Sections \ref{sub:products} and \ref{sub:valueit} we show how to partially circumvent scalability issues by exploiting the factored structure.

\subsection{Two-Stage Solution}
\label{sub:decompose}

\end{center}
  \caption{Illustration of aggregate systems $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$ constructed as serial products, where $\MDP_{env}$ is itself a parallel product.}
  \label{fig:agg}
\end{figure}

We decouple the problem by letting the copter execute first, followed by the rover. The goal of the copter is then one of exploring the uncertain environment in a way that maximizes knowledge about the satisfiability of the rover task. To solve this problem via sequential value iteration we convert the scLTL specification into a DFSA $\MDP_{\varphi}$ and consider the two separate systems illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:agg}. We assume that the initial position $\xi_r^0$ of the rover is known, and let $\xi_\varphi^0$ be the initial state of the specification automaton. We propose the following two-step solution:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item For $\xi_1 = (\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$ let $g(\xi_1', v') = \max( \ind_{X_f}(\xi_\varphi'), v' )$ and compute the value functions $V^1_t(\xi_1)$ for $t = T_r, T_r-1 \ldots, 0$ via the Bellman iterations
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:valit1}
  \begin{aligned}
      V^1_{T_r}(\xi_1) & = g(\xi_1, 0), \\
      V^1_{t-1} (\xi_1) & = \max_{u_r} \sum_{\xi_1'} T(\xi_1' \mid \xi_1, u_r) g(\xi_1', V_t(\xi_1')).
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation} 
  \item For $\xi_2 = (\xi_c, \xi_e)$, compute the value functions $V^2_t(\xi_2)$ for $t = T_c, T_c-1, \ldots, 0$ via the Bellman iterations
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:valit2}
  \begin{aligned}
    V_{T_c}^2(\xi_2) & = \ind_{X_l} (\xi_c) \times V^1_0(\xi_r^0, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi^0), \\
    V_{t-1}^2(\xi_2) & = \max_{u_c} \sum_{\xi_2'} T(\xi_2' \mid \xi_2, u_c) V^2_t(\xi_2').
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
The interpretation of these value functions are as follows: $V_t^1(\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$ is the probability that the rover will satisfy its mission if at time $t$ the state of $\MDP_1$ is $(\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$. The copter is tasked with minimizing the entropy at the initial states $\xi_r^0, \xi_\varphi^0$ that the rover \emph{can not affect}, by updating the belief $\xi_e$ that it \emph{can affect} via environment exploration in the way most beneficial for task knowledge. In addition, the requirement that the rover must be in the landing zone $X_l$ at time $T_c$ has been incorporated in the value function. Thus, $V_t^2(x_c, x_e)$ represents the probability that the rover will have a successful execution, and that the copter can land in $X_l$, if the copter-environment state at time $t$ is $(x_c, x_e)$. In addition to the value functions, time-dependent policies that maximize the value functions can be extracted as the maximizing argument.



\subsection{Knowledge Optimization}
\label{sub:information}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Talk about maximizing prob. of satisfaction, negative entropy, etc
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Product MDPs}
\label{sub:products}

We first define two types of products between two MDPs $\MDP_1 = (\X_1, \init_1, \U_1, \tr_1)$ and $\MDP_2 = (\X_2, \init_2, \U_2, \tr_2)$: serial and parallel products.
\begin{definition}
  The \textbf{parallel product} of $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$ is the MDP $\MDP_1 \otimes_{par} \MDP_2 = (\X_1 \times \X_2, \init_{par}, \U_1 \times \U_2, \tr_{par})$, where
  \begin{equation}
    \init_{par}(x_1, x_2) = \init_1(x_1) \init_2(x_2)
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
      \tr_{par}&(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, u_1, u_2) \\
      & = \tr_1 (x_1' \mid x_1, u_1) \tr_2 (x_2' \mid x_2, u_2)
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  Given a \textbf{connection} $C : \X_1 \rightarrow \U_2$, the \textbf{serial product} of $\MDP_1$ and $\MDP_2$ is the MDP $\MDP_1 \otimes_{ser}^C \MDP_2 = (\X_1 \times \X_2, \init_{ser}, \U_1, \tr_{ser})$,
  where
  \begin{equation}
    \init_{ser}(x_1, x_2) = \init_1(x_1) \init_2(x_2)
  \end{equation}
  and
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:serial}
  \begin{aligned}
      \tr_{ser}&(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, u_1) \\
      & = \tr_1 (x_1' \mid x_1, u_1) \tr_2 (x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1') )
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
\end{definition}
In a parallel product there is no interaction between the two MDPs. Conversely, in a serial product a transition $x_1 \rightarrow x_1'$ in $\MDP_1$ triggers an action $C(x_1')$ in $\MDP_2$ that results in a transition in $x_2' \sim T_2(\cdot \mid x_2, C(x_1'))$
Both products can be generalized to more than two components and products can also be nested: e.g. $\MDP_1 \otimes_{ser}^C \left( \MDP_2 \otimes_{par} \MDP_3 \right)$. Large nested products lead to large state spaces, and since the size of the transition matrix is quadratic in the size of the state space, computation of the aggregate transition matrix quickly becomes challenging. However, we next show that value iteration can be done sequentially over subsystems without computing the aggregate transition matrices.


\subsection{Value Iteration for Product MDPs}
\label{sub:valueit}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \red{Can we include action in Bellman op?}\sofie{Do you mean to do a Q-iteration? Have a value function that ranges over both action and state? This could be troublesome as it would increase the size of the value function.}
\end{itemize}


Given a function $g: \X \times \mathbb{R}_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, consider a general Bellman operator $\bellman : (\X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+) \rightarrow (\X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+)$ on the following form:
\begin{equation}
  (\bellman V) (x) = \max_{\pol \in (\X \rightarrow \U)} \sum_{x' \in \X}  g(x', V(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x)).
\end{equation}

The optimal value function $V^*$ and policy $\pol^*$ for a given bellman operator $\bellman$ is then found via the iterations

\sofie{Define the set of allowed policies : $\mathbf \Pi$ the set of measurable functions mapping from $\X$ to $\U$.  You cannot take any possible function due to measurability issues.  }
The optimal value function $V^*$ and policy $\pol^*$ for a given bellman operator $\bellman$ is found via the iterations

\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:value_iter}
  \begin{align}
    & V^*_0 \equiv 0, \\
    & V^*_{k+1}  = \bellman V_k \label{eq:iter}, \\
    & \pol^* \in \argmax_{\pol \in (\X \rightarrow \U)} \sum_{x' \in \X}  g(x', V^*(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x)).
  \end{align}
\end{subequations}

\begin{example}
  For the Bellman operator corresponding to reaching a set $X_f$, the function $g$ is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    g(x', v') = \max( \ind_{X_f}(x'), v').
  \end{equation*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  Consider the finite-horizon optimal control problem 
  \begin{equation}
     \max \sum_{t=0}^T J_t(x_t).
  \end{equation} 
  In this case, if the dynamic programming is initialized with $V_T(x) = J_T(x)$, iterated applications of the Bellman operator corresponding to $g_t(x', v') = J_{t-1}(x') + v'$, i.e.
  \begin{equation*}
    V_{t-1}(x) = \bellman_t V_{t} (x) = \max_{\pol} (J_{t-1}(x') + V_{t}(x')) T(x' \mid x, \pol(x))
  \end{equation*}
  computes the value function at times $T-1, T-2, \ldots, 0$.
\end{example}

We now consider the Bellman iteration step for product MDPs. For a serial product we get
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  \bellman V (x_1, x_2) = \max_{\pol: (\X_1 \times \X_2 \rightarrow \U_1)} \sum_{x_1', x_2' \in \X_1 \times \X_2} \hspace{-4mm} g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) \\
   \quad \times T_{ser}(x_1', x_2' \mid x_1, x_2, \pol(x_1, x_2)) \\
   = \max_{\pol: (\X_1 \times \X_2 \rightarrow \U_1)} \sum_{x_1' \in \X_1} T_1(x_1' \mid x_1, \pol(x_1, x_2)) \\
   \quad \times \sum_{x_2' \in \X_2}  g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) T_2(x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1')).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
It follows that the Bellman update $V \mapsto \bellman V$ for a serial product can be computed via back-stepping as follows:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  W_2(x_1', x_2') & = g(x_1', x_2', V(x_1', x_2')) \\
  W_1(x_1', x_2) & = \sum_{x_2' \in \X_2}  T_2(x_2' \mid x_2, C(x_1')) W_2(x_1', x_2'), \\
  \bellman V(x_1, x_2) & = \max_{\pol} \sum_{x_1' \in \X_1} T_1(x_1' \mid x_1, \pol(x_1, x_2)) W_1(x_1', x_2).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
The procedure generalizes immediately to $n$-length serial products and steps
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:general_decomp}
\begin{aligned}
  & W_{i-1}(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_i, \ldots, x_n) \\
  & \quad = \sum_{x_{i}' \in \X_{i}} \left[ \begin{aligned} & T_{i} (x_{i}' \mid x_{i}, C(x_{i-1}')) \\ 
   & \times W_{i} (x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_k', \ldots, x_n)
    \end{aligned} \right].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{remark}
  In serial products of arbitrary length a connection $C_i$ can be defined either as $C_i: \X_{i-1} \rightarrow \U_i$, or as $C_i: \prod_{j \in \Gamma_i} \X_j \rightarrow \U_i$ for some index set $\Gamma_i$ that determine which preceding systems that affect the input to system $i$.
\end{remark}

In addition, if $\MDP_{i+1}$ is itself a serial or parallel product, \eqref{eq:general_decomp} can again be decomposed. If for instance $\MDP_{i} = \MDP_{i_1} \otimes_{par} \MDP_{i_2}$ is a parallel product we can write $x_i = (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2})$ and \eqref{eq:general_decomp} can be computed as
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
  W_{i_1}(\ldots (x_{i_1}', x_{i_2}) \ldots) & = \hspace{-2mm} \sum_{x_{i_2}'  \in \X_{i_2}} \left[ \begin{aligned} T_{i_2}(x_{i_2}' \mid x_{i_2}, C(x_{i-1}') ) \\ \times W_i(\ldots (x_{i_1}', x_{i_2}') \ldots) \end{aligned} \right], \\
  W_{i-1}(\ldots (x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}) \ldots)  & =  \hspace{-2mm} \sum_{x_{i_1}' \in \X_{i_1}} \left[ \begin{aligned} T_{i_1}(x_{i_1}' \mid x_{i_1}, C(x_{i-1}') ) \\
  	\times W_{i_1}(\ldots (x_{i_1}', x_{i_2}) \ldots)	
  \end{aligned} \right].
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
As a consequence, for any aggregate system constructed from serial and parallel products, iterative value function computation for this type of Bellman operator can be performed without explicitly computing aggregate transition probabilities. The sequential approach is advantageous when the connections are sparse, i.e. the connection mappings $C$ can be compactly represented.

% \begin{remark}
%   The difference between sequential value iteration and centralized value iteration can be illustrated in tensor notation. Let $T_{u_i x_i}^{x_i'}$ be the transition matrix for system $i$ and let $U_{x'_{i-1}}^{u_i} = \ind_{C_{i-1}(x'_{i-1}) = u_i}$, then sequential computation is as follows:
%   \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:tensor_sequential}
%   \begin{aligned}
%       & W_{x_1' \ldots, x_n'} = g(x_1', \ldots, x_n', V_{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}) \\
%       & \text{for $k = n, n-1, \ldots, 2$}: \\
%       & \quad W_{x_1'\ldots x_{k-1}' x_{k} \ldots x_n} = U_{x_{k-1}}^{u_k} T_{u_k x_k}^{x_k'}  W_{x_1'\ldots x_k' x_{k+1} \ldots x_n'} \quad \\
%       & V_{x_1\ldots x_n} = \max_{u_1} T^{x_1'}_{u_1x_1} W_{x_1' x_2 \ldots x_n}
%   \end{aligned}
%   \end{equation}
%   This can be contrasted with the naive approach where one first constructs the aggregate transition tensor $T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}$ and then computes
%   \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:tensor_naive}
%     V_{x_1, \ldots x_n} = \max_{u_1} T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'} g(x_1', \ldots, x_n', V_{x_1', \ldots x_n'}).
%   \end{equation}
%   Eq \eqref{eq:tensor_naive} involves the same number of multiplications as \eqref{eq:tensor_sequential}, but the expensive construction of $T_{u_1 x_1 \ldots x_n}^{x_1', \ldots, x_n'}$ is avoided in \eqref{eq:tensor_sequential}.

\begin{example}
  We demonstrate the advantage of sequential value iteration with a numerical example. We consider $k$-length serial products of MDPs with two actions and six states each; the total number of states in such a product is $6^k$. For increasing values of $k$ we compute the probability of reaching a certain part of the state space by sequential value iteration, and by naively forming the overall transitions matrices. Figure \ref{fig:scalability} illustrates the computation time for increasing values of $k$ over 10 trials. As can be seen, the advantage of sequential value iteration over the naive approach is significant.
\end{example}
\sofie{I thought the most important part was the memory limitations? That is why I normally implement it.}

\begin{remark}
	The back-stepping approach above can easily be extended to the case of \emph{non-deterministic} set-valued connections $C : \X_1 \rightarrow 2^{\U_2}$. Non-deterministic connections are appropriate when there is uncertainty about what input that will be triggered. For instance, they result naturally in abstractions constructed to over-approximate the true behavior \cite{Haesaert18}. When non-determinism is present the aggregate system is no longer a MDP, but can be regarded as a two-player stochastic system where an adversary controls the non-determinism. In this case, the worst-case resolution of non-determinism should be taken into account in value iteration. This is straightforward to incorporate into our back stepping approach by introducing an extra minimizer over non-determinism:
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{aligned}
	  & W_{i-1}(x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_i, \ldots, x_n) \\
	  & \quad = \sum_{x_{i}' \in \X_{i}} \min_{u_i \in C(x_{i-1}')} \left[ \begin{aligned} & T_{i} (x_{i}' \mid x_{i}, u_i) \\ 
	   & \times W_{i} (x_1', \ldots, x_{i-1}', x_k', \ldots, x_n)
	    \end{aligned} \right].
	\end{aligned}
	\end{equation*}
\end{remark}

% \subsection{Sparse Value Function via Tensor Decomposition}

% In the previous subsection we outlined how Bellman iterations for a value function can be performed sequentially in product systems. However, a dense value function representation is still of size $\mathcal O (|\X_1| |\X_2|)$ which can constitute a bottleneck for large products. In this section we explore how computational efficiency can be improved by using sparse value function representations. The cost is a loss of precision and guarantees with respect to the final value function.

% Possible sparse representations
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item CP representation
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Pro: can be mapped through CP linear operators via ALS
%     \item Con: value iteration is nonlinear
%     \item What about policy iteration with sparse policy? 
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item TT representation
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Pro: Black-box cross algorithm to approximate tensor via sampling
%     \item Con: No analysis, brute force
%   \end{itemize}
%   \item Serial-parts, e.g. $V^1_{x_r e_1 \phi} \ldots V^n_{x_r e_n \phi}$
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item Pro: May be suited to problem
%     \item Con: Don't know how to update components, convergence not understood
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection{Related work}

A generalization of serial and parallel products are \emph{factored MDPs} \cite{Boutilier2000}. In a factored MDP with local states $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ the state update for $x_i$ only depends on the \emph{scope} $\Gamma_i$, i.e. $T(x_i \mid x) = T(x_i \mid x_j, j \in \Gamma_i)$. Evidently, this structure encompasses parallel and serial products: in a serial product $\Gamma_i = \{ i-1, i \}$, whereas in a parallel product $\Gamma_i = \{ i \}$. The value function for a factored MDP is not necessarily sparse; a reasonable approach is therefore to resort to approximate methods and represent the value function as a linear combination of factored basis functions. Approximate algorithms for the standard reward-maximizing problem include \cite{Guestrin2003} for approximate policy iteration and approximate linear programming, and \cite{Szita2008} for approximate value iteration. Other work utilizes symbolic representations to improve scalability \cite{Boutilier2000}.

The back-stepping Bellman computation is an example of a factored sum-product algorithm \cite{Kschischang2001}, that has previously been used for a similar purpose as ours in the context of MDP abstractions \cite{EsmaeilZadehSoudjani2017}.

\section{Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

We consider a two-asset mission consisting of a ground rover and a flying copter 

\subsection{Problem setup}

\paragraph{Abstract Robot Models}

We denote the location of robot and copter with $x_r \in \mathbb{R}^2$ and $x_c \in \mathbb{R}^3$. For a given domain $\X_r \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ and $\X_c \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ we introduce abstract states $\xi_r \in [\X_r]_{N_{rx}, N_{ry}}$ and $\xi_d \in [\X_c]_{N_{cx}, N_{cy}, N_{cz}}$, where e.g. $N_{rx}$ is the number of discrete states along the $x$ axis. 

We assume that both robots freely can move east, north, west, or south between the discrete states while remaining in the workspace, and that the copter can additionally adjust its elevation by moving up and down. With these assumptions we can model the rover with an MDP $\MDP_{rov}$ with $N_{rx} N_{ry}$ states and $4$ inputs, and the copter as an MDP $\MDP_{copt}$ with $N_{cx} N_{cy} N_{cz}$ states and $6$ inputs. In the following we fix $N_{rx} = N_{ry} = N_{cx} = N_{cy} = 10$ and $N_{cz} = 2$, i.e. both robots move on a 10x10 grid in 2D space, and the copter can fly at two different altitudes (in the following referred to as \emph{high} and \emph{low}).

\paragraph{Low-level Robot Controllers}

How quadrotors are controlled to move between discrete states. \red{Can we provide some guarantees under reasonable assumptions?}
\sofie{What are the options? Can you compute a barrier function ? Can you do something like lyapunov stability? Input output stability.. }

\paragraph{Environment Belief Model}

  \label{fig:envmdp}
\end{figure}

We assume that regions of interest have been extracted from low-resolution satellite imagery, along with prior probability estimates for the likelihood that the regions exhibit certain traits. Here we restrict attention to \emph{risk regions} that may contain obstacles the rover can not traverse, and \emph{target regions} that are likely places where scientific samples can be extracted. We associate to each region $R$ a belief MDP $\MDP_{R}$ with five states $\zeta \in \{ 0, p_-, p_0, p_+, 1\}$ and three inputs $v \in \{ N, W, S \}$ for (N)o measurement, (W)eak measurement, and (S)trong measurement. The transition matrices are $T_N = I_5$, 
\begin{equation}
  T_{S} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  0   \\
    \bar p_- &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_- \\
    \bar p_0 &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_0 \\
    \bar p_+ &  0  &  0  &  0  &  p_+ \\
    0        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right],
  T_{W} = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1        &  0                &  0  &  0           &  0   \\
    q\bar p_-&  \bar q \bar p_-  &  0  &  \bar q p_-  &  q p_- \\
    q\bar p_0&  \bar q \bar p_0  &  0  &  \bar q p_0  &  q p_0 \\
    q\bar p_+&  \bar q \bar p_+  &  0  &  \bar q p_+  &  q p_+ \\
    0        &  0  &  0  &  0  &  1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right].
\end{equation}
Here $q$ is a parameter denoting the quality of the weak measurement: if $q=0$ weak measurements are incapable of determining the true nature of the region, only intermediate beliefs $p_-$ and $p_+$ can be reached. For $q \in (0,1]$ there is a probability of a transition to a belief state 0 or 1. The outgoing transitions from $p_0$ are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:envmdp}.

Given belief MDPs $\MDP_{R_i}$ for every region of interest, we construct the environment model $M_{env}$ as the parallel product
\begin{equation}
  \MDP_{env} = \MDP_{R_1} \otimes_{par} \MDP_{R_1}  \otimes_{par} \ldots \otimes_{par} \MDP_{R_n}. 
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Specification}

The objective of the mission is to satisfy a scLTL specification $\varphi$ over propositions over states in $\MDP_{rov}$ and $\MDP_{env}$. Examples of such propositions include
\begin{itemize}
  \item Don't enter a risk region $R_1$ that may contain an obstacle: $\xi_r \not  \in R_1 \lor \xi_1 = 0$.
  \item Collect a sample at region $R_2$: $\xi_r \in R_2 \land \xi_2 = 1$.
\end{itemize}

We posit that the rover has a time window of length $T_r$ to fulfill its mission, and that the copter has battery sufficient to operate for a time $T_c$. In addition, the copter must land in a pre-designated landing area $X_l$ at the end of the execution. Given these constraints, the challenge is to find strategies for both the copter and rover that maximize the probability that the science specification is fulfilled.


\paragraph{Measurement model}

The serial connections are defined via connections that map the state of one system to the input of the next. These connections are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the rover is adjacent to a region $R_i$ it takes a (S)trong measurement of that region,
  \item If the copter is at low altitude and in region $R_i$, it takes a (S)trong measurement of that region,
  \item If the copter is at high altitude and within distance $2$ of region $R_i$, it takes a (W)eak measurement of that region,
  \item The connection between the $\MDP_{rov} \otimes_{ser} \MDP_{env}$ product and $\MDP_{\varphi}$ is given by the truth value of atomic propositions for the state $(\xi_r, \xi_e)$.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Illustrations}

We demonstrate the features of the proposed solution in a few example scenarios.

\paragraph{Scenario 1} If a sample of type $A$ exists, collect samples of types $A$ and $B$, otherwise collect a sample of type $C$, all while avoiding obstacles. Letting $\lozenge_o \varphi = \lnot \texttt{obstacle} \; \mathcal U \; \varphi$, the specification can be written
\begin{equation*}
  \left( \lozenge_o \texttt{sA} \land \lozenge_o \right) \texttt{sB} \lor \left( \lozenge_o ( \texttt{eA} \land \texttt{sC} ) \right).
\end{equation*}
The atomic propositions are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{sA} is $\True$ if $\xi_r \in A$ (rover is in region $A$) and $\zeta_A = 1$ (sample detected in $A$), and similarly for \texttt{sB} and \texttt{sC},
	\item \texttt{eA} is $\True$ if $\zeta_A = 0$ (there is no sample at $A$)
\end{itemize}
The workspace is shown in Figure \ref{fig:workspace1}; the prior probability estimates are $0.5$ for each region. We assume that the rover can move 15 length units, and that the copter has enough battery to move 30 length units (including changes of altitude). With the two-stage approach described in Section \ref{sec:solution} we can then compute 1) a value function $V_r(\xi_r, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi)$ and corresponding policy for the rover, and 2) a policy for the quadrotor that maximizes the following expression:
\begin{equation}
	\max \left( 2 | V_r(\xi_r^0, \xi_e, \xi_\varphi^0) - 0.5 |, 0.5 \right).
\end{equation}
This objective favors probabilities close to 0 and 1, but does not punish probabilities around 0.5 excessively. 

Copter executions generated from this policy are shown in Figure \ref{fig:copter_executions} for different configurations of the true environment state. Without only prior knowledge about the environment, the probability that the rover can satisfy the specification is $V_r(\xi_r^0, \xi_e^0, \xi_\varphi^0) = 0.25$. However, after the copter executions all uncertainty is removed: for the two upper examples in Figure \ref{fig:copter_executions} $V_r(\xi_r^0, \xi_e(T_{c}), \xi_\varphi^0) = 1$, and for the lower examples $V_r(\xi_r^0, \xi_e(T_{c}), \xi_\varphi^0) = 0$. This shows that the generated policy explores the environment in a way that efficiently reduces uncertainty about whether the specification can be achieved.
