\section{Introduction}
As a world leader in space exploration, NASA advances deep space exploration missions and continues to uncover vast amount of new knowledge about the universe.
In order to satisfy a set of high-level science and engineering goals for every space robotic mission, a step-by-step planning and scheduling of spacecraft operations is required. This involves generating a sequence of low-level spacecraft commands that according to the goal of the mission, describes the action plan of the robot. The action plans is a series of states, and actions in order to move from one state to another.

\subsection{ASPEN}\label{sec:aspen}
ASPEN (Automated Scheduling and Planning ENvironment) encodes spacecraft operability constraints, flight rules, spacecraft hardware models, science experiment goals, and operations procedures to allow for automated generation of low-level spacecraft sequences. ASPEN contains a number of innovations including: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item an expressive but easy to use modeling language
  \item multiple search (inference) engines
  \item iterative repair suited for mixed-initiative human in loop operations
  \item real-time replanning and response (in the CASPER system)
  \item plan optimization
\end{itemize}
 
 ASPEN is being used for the Citizen Explorer (CX-1) (August 2000 launch) and the 2nd Antarctic Mapping Missions (AMM-2) (September 2000). ASPEN has also been used to automate ground communications stations – automating generation of tracking plans for the Deep Space Terminal (DS-T). ASPEN has been used to demonstrate automated command generation and onboard planning for rovers and is currently being evaluated for operational use for the Mars-01 Marie Curie rover mission. CASPER, the soft real-time versions of ASPEN, has been demonstrated with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) Mission Data Systems (MDS) Control Architecture prototypes..
